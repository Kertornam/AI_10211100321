Course: CE4143  Introduction to Artificial Intelligence  
Institution: Academic City University
Lecturer: Mr. Godwin Ntow Danso  



 1. Project Overview

This project was designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts in Artificial Intelligence through a modular, interactive web based application. Each section of the project implements a different machine learning or AI technique in line with the course content. The web application was built using Python and Streamlit and deployed via Streamlit Cloud.

The application consists of four major modules:
 Linear Regression
 KMeans Clustering
 Neural Network Classification
 Large Language Model with RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG)



 2. Tools and Libraries Used

 Python 3.9
 Streamlit
 Pandas
 Numpy
 Scikitlearn
 Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
 SentenceTransformers
 Google Generative AI SDK (Gemini)

 4. Module 1: Linear Regression

Objective: To implement a linear regression model to predict housing prices using the California Housing dataset.

Steps Taken:
1. Loaded the builtin California housing dataset from Scikitlearn.
2. Selected numeric features: `MedInc`, `HouseAge`, `AveRooms`, `AveOccup`.
3. Preprocessed data and split into training and testing sets.
4. Trained a linear regression model.
5. Evaluated performance using Mean Absolute Error and Rsquared.
6. Visualized predicted vs actual housing prices.
7. Added user input interface for predictions.



 5. Module 2: Clustering

Objective: To cluster uploaded customer data using the KMeans algorithm.

Steps Taken:
1. Allowed CSV file upload.
2. Autodetected numeric features for clustering.
3. Used KMeans from Scikitlearn to perform clustering based on userselected features and cluster count.
4. Displayed 2D or 3D plots depending on feature selection.
5. Added download functionality for the resulting clustered dataset.



 6. Module 3: Neural Network

Objective: To classify data using a basic feedforward neural network.

Steps Taken:
1. Allowed user to upload a classification dataset.
2. Allowed selection of target column.
3. Encoded labels and scaled numeric features.
4. Split data into training and testing sets.
5. Trained an MLPClassifier (Multilayer Perceptron) from Scikitlearn.
6. Evaluated model with accuracy and classification report.
7. Enabled configuration of network parameters via sidebar.



 7. Module 4: LLM with RetrievalAugmented Generation

Objective: To allow natural language querying of the Ghana Election Result dataset using a Large Language Model (LLM).

Steps Taken:
1. Allowed CSV upload of `Ghana_Election_Result.csv`.
2. Transformed rows into string chunks for semantic embedding.
3. Used SentenceTransformers to encode dataset rows and user question.
4. Retrieved topk most relevant rows using cosine similarity.
5. Built a prompt using those rows as context.
6. Sent prompt to Gemini Pro model via Google Generative AI SDK.
7. Displayed the answer generated by Gemini.



 8. Deployment and Submission

Deployment Platform: Streamlit Cloud

Deployment Steps:

 9. Conclusion

This project helped reinforce concepts taught during the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course. By building and integrating regression, clustering, classification, and LLM modules, I gained practical experience in working with real world data, training machine learning models, and deploying AI powered applications.

The use of the Gemini model to power a question answering system via retrieval augmented generation was a key highlight of the project, demonstrating the potential of modern LLMs when combined with structured data.
